### How does `graphql-yoga` compare to `apollo-server` and other tools?

As mentioned above, `graphql-yoga` is built on top of a variety of other packages, such as `graphql.js`, `express` and  `apollo-server`. Each of these provide a certain piece of functionality required for building a GraphQL server.

Using these packages individually incurs overhead in the setup process and requires you to write a lot of boilerplate. `graphql-yoga` abstracts away the initial complexity and required boilerplate and let's you get started quickly with a set of sensible defaults for your server configuration.

`graphql-yoga` is like [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for building GraphQL servers.

### Can't I just setup my own GraphQL server using `express` and `graphql.js`?

`graphql-yoga` is all about convenience and a great "Getting Started"-experience by abstracting away the complexity that comes along when you're building your own GraphQL from scratch. It's a pragmatic approach to bootstrap a GraphQL server, much like [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) removes friction when first starting out with React.

Whenever the defaults of `graphql-yoga` are too tight of a corset for you, you can simply _eject_ from it and use the tooling it's build upon - there's no lock-in or any other kind of magic going on preventing you from this.

### How to eject from the standard `express` setup?

The core value of `graphql-yoga` is that you don't have to write the boilerplate required to configure your [express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/) application. However, once you need to add more customized behaviour to your server, the default configuration provided by `graphql-yoga` might not suit your use case any more. For example, it might be the case that you want to add more custom _middleware_ to your server, like for logging or error reporting.

For these cases, `GraphQLServer` exposes the `express.Application` directly via its [`express`](./src/index.ts#L17) property:

```js
server.express.use(myMiddleware())
```

Middlewares can also be added specifically to the GraphQL endpoint route, by using:

```js
server.express.post(server.options.endpoint, myMiddleware())
```

Any middlewares you add to that route, will be added right before the `apollo-server-express` middleware.
