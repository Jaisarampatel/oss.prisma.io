# GraphQL Boilerplates 

## Bootstrapping GraphQL boilerplates

[GraphQL boilerplates](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates) provide starter kits for your next GraphQL projects. They are based on industry best practices and the latest tooling from the GraphQL ecosystem. They are also preconfigured with `.graphqlconfig`.

You can bootstrap a GraphQL boilerplate using the `graphql create` command.

**Example 1**: Use the interactive prompt to select one of the available boilerplate projects (e.g. Node, TypeScript, React, Vue, ...)

```sh
graphql create myapp
```

This creates a new directory called `myapp` where your project files will be located.

**Example 2**: Bootstrap the [`typescript-advanced`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/typescript-graphql-server/tree/master/advanced) boilerplate

```sh
graphql create myapp --boilerplate typescript-advanced
```

This creates a new directory called `myapp` where your project files will be located.

**Example 3**: Bootstrap the [`react-fullstack-basic`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/react-fullstack-graphql/tree/master/basic) boilerplate

```sh
graphql create myapp --boilerplate react-fullstack-basic
```

This creates a new directory called `myapp` where your project files will be located.
